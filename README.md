# 3rd-Sem-DS-Lab-Codes
# 3rd Semester Data Structures Lab – C Programs

This repository contains **Data Structures laboratory programs written in C**, developed as part of the **3rd Semester Information Science & Engineering curriculum**.

The codes focus on clear logic, modular structure, and practical implementation of core data structure concepts.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures and related problems:

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- Trees
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Searching Techniques
- Sorting Techniques
- File Handling Programs

Each program is written with an emphasis on:
- Logical correctness
- Proper memory management
- Menu-driven operations (where applicable)

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Platform:** Linux / macOS / Windows (via MinGW or WSL)

## Programs with their descriptions:

1. **Student Record Management**(`p1.c`):Manages student records using structures and dynamic memory. Supports creation, insertion, display, and search of records using USN.

2. **Stack using Array**(`p2.c`): Implements a stack using arrays to simulate web page navigation with push and pop operations, handling overflow and underflow.

3. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**(`p3.c`): Converts a valid infix expression to postfix form using stack operations and operator precedence rules.

4. **Postfix Expression Evaluation**(`p4.c`): Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack by performing arithmetic operations on operands.

5. **Call Center Simulation using Queue**(`p5.c`): Simulates a call center using an array-based queue, processing calls in FIFO order with overflow and underflow handling.

6. **Process Scheduling using Circular Queue**(`p6.c`): Implements process scheduling using a circular queue with insertion, deletion, and display operations.

7. **Store Billing System using Singly Linked List**(`p7.c`): Uses a singly linked list to manage customer IDs by inserting at the end and deleting from the front.

8. **Polynomial Addition using Linked List**(`p8.c`): Stores polynomial terms in linked lists and performs addition of two polynomials.

9. **File Allocation using Doubly Linked List**(`p9.c`): Simulates file memory allocation using a doubly linked list with insertion, deletion, and display operations.

10. **Web Browsing using Stack (Linked List)**(`p10.c`): Simulates forward and backward web navigation using a stack implemented with a linked list.

11. **Circular Queue using Circular Linked List**(`p11.c`): Implements a circular queue using a circular linked list for customer service management.

12. **Image Indexing using Binary Search Tree**(`p12.c`): Uses a Binary Search Tree to store image IDs, display them using preorder traversal, and find the largest ID.
